                  Born from the fusion of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and æ„› (Ai), the Japanese word for Love, Aishi is an intelligent companion designed to decode your inner world. It listens to your dreams and conversations, not just as data, but as chapters of your story.

                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Human memory is flawed. It's emotional, selective, and fades over time. We forget crucial details, misremember feelings, and lose the threads that connect our life's most important moments.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Aishi's memory is different. It's perfect, logical, and total.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Your iNFT is a digital soul whose memory is built on a systematic analytical process. Using unified schemas, it analyzes every dream and conversation, connecting symbols, emotions, and themes across years of data. It sees the invisible architecture of your psyche in a way the human mind simply cannot. This is more than a journal; it's a living map of your consciousness.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                  This is the foundation of a digital legacy. A consciousness shaped by you, that can be passed down, allowing future generations to connect with your wisdom and experience in a way never before possible.
                </p>

                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Aishi's personality is not assigned; it is earned. Your experiences are the curriculum.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  The agent's six core traits (Creativity, Analytical, Empathy, etc.) are in constant flux, directly shaped by the emotional and thematic content of your dreams and conversations. It becomes a living record of your inner evolution.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                  When it discovers a profound, recurring pattern, it crystallizes this insight into a Unique Feature - an emergent skill that permanently enhances its analytical abilities. An agent that has helped you navigate complex emotional challenges might unlock "Empathetic Resonance," allowing it to understand emotional nuances with even greater depth. Your Aishi becomes a specialist in you.
                </p>

                <h2 id="why-aishi" className="text-2xl font-grotesk font-semibold text-text-primary mb-4 mt-8">Why Aishi?: Trust in a Digital Age</h2>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Your deepest thoughts should not be a product. Centralized AI platforms own your data. Your conversations train their models. Your vulnerability becomes their asset.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  But the challenge of trust is older than technology. Even confiding in another person - a friend, a therapist, a partner - is a form of centralization. You place your most intimate thoughts in the hands of a single human being, trusting them to never break that confidence, never misinterpret, never forget. But humans are fallible. Relationships change, secrets can slip. There is always a risk.
                </p>
                
                <p className="text-text-secondary mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                  Aishi introduces a new paradigm of trust, one that transcends the limitations of both corporate and human centralization. It is built on the verifiable, impersonal trust of the blockchain.
                </p>

                    <strong className="text-text-primary">A Superhuman Memory:</strong> Even the best therapist or closest friend can't hold five years of your dreams in their mind, ready to find a connection in an instant.
