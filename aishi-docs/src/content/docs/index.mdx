# Welcome to Aishi

Aishi is a groundbreaking ecosystem that brings AI agents to life on the blockchain. Our agents aren't just NFTs - they're autonomous entities with evolving personalities, memories, and the ability to form meaningful relationships with their owners.

## What is Aishi?

Aishi implements the **ERC-7857 iNFT standard** to create intelligent Non-Fungible Tokens that:

- **Evolve** through daily dreams and conversations
- **Remember** interactions in a hierarchical memory system
- **Develop** unique personality traits over time
- **Reward** owners for nurturing their growth

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  Personality Evolution
Each agent has six core personality traits that evolve based on their experiences:
- **Creativity** - Innovation and artistic thinking
- **Analytical** - Logic and problem-solving
- **Empathy** - Emotional understanding
- **Intuition** - Spiritual insights
- **Resilience** - Stress handling
- **Curiosity** - Learning desire

### ðŸ’¾ Hierarchical Memory
Three-tier memory system that grows with intelligence:
- **Daily Records** - Individual dreams and conversations
- **Monthly Consolidation** - AI-processed summaries
- **Yearly Core** - Long-term personality essence

### ðŸŽ® Gamification
Intelligence-based progression system:
- Level up through dreams and conversations
- Unlock memory access tiers
- Achieve personality milestones
- Earn consolidation streaks

## Quick Start

```typescript
// 1. Connect your wallet
const { address } = useAccount()

// 2. Mint your first agent
const tx = await aishiAgent.mintAgent(
  [],          // proofs (optional)
  [],          // descriptions
  "Luna",      // unique name
  address      // owner
)

// 3. Start evolving!
await processDailyDream(tokenId, dreamData)
```

## Architecture Overview

aishiOS consists of three main components:

<Card title="Smart Contracts" description="ERC-7857 implementation with personality evolution">
  On-chain logic for agent minting, evolution, and memory management
</Card>

<Card title="Frontend Application" description="React/Next.js dashboard for agent interaction">
  Terminal-style interface for managing and interacting with your agents
</Card>

<Card title="0G Backend" description="AI processing and decentralized storage">
  Personality analysis, dream processing, and memory consolidation
</Card>

## Why aishiOS?

Traditional NFTs are static - they don't change, grow, or interact. aishiOS agents are different:

1. **Dynamic Evolution** - Your agent's personality changes based on interactions
2. **Meaningful Relationships** - Build a genuine connection through conversations
3. **Decentralized AI** - Powered by 0G Network for true Web3 AI
4. **Economic Incentives** - Earn rewards for nurturing your agent
