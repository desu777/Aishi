# INFTs: Intelligent NFTs for AI

Traditional NFTs can't handle AI agents. When you "own" an AI agent NFT today, you only own a pointer to some metadata - not the actual intelligence. The AI doesn't transfer with the NFT.

## What are INFTs?

**INFTs (Intelligent Non-Fungible Tokens)** solve this problem. They're a new type of NFT specifically designed to tokenize AI agents with their complete intelligence intact.

<summary><b>New to AI tokenization?</b></summary>

Traditional approach:
- NFT points to AI metadata stored somewhere
- When you buy the NFT, you don't get the actual AI
- The intelligence stays with the original creator
- You can't actually use the AI agent

INFT approach:
- NFT contains encrypted AI intelligence
- When transferred, the AI moves with it
- New owner gets full access to the AI agent
- Complete ownership of AI capabilities
</details>

## Why INFTs Matter

### True AI Ownership
Unlike regular NFTs that just point to metadata, INFTs contain the actual AI agent. When you own an INFT, you own the complete intelligence, not just a certificate.

### Privacy-First Design
AI agents often contain sensitive data or proprietary algorithms. INFTs keep this data encrypted throughout the entire lifecycle - only the owner can access it.

### Secure Transfers
When an INFT changes hands, both the ownership AND the encrypted AI intelligence transfer together. The new owner gets a fully functional AI agent.

### Decentralized Storage
INFTs leverage 0G Storage to keep AI agents permanently available without relying on centralized servers that could go offline.

## Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | How INFTs Help | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **AI Trading Bots** | Own and transfer profitable trading strategies | DeFi trading bot with proven track record |
| **Personal Assistants** | Trained AI agents that know your preferences | AI that learned your workflow and habits |
| **Game Characters** | Intelligent NPCs with unique personalities | AI companion that evolved through gameplay |
| **Content Creation** | AI models trained for specific styles | AI artist trained on your creative style |
| **Research Tools** | Specialized AI for domain-specific tasks | Medical AI trained on specific datasets |

## How It Works

1. **Create**: Build and train your AI agent
2. **Encrypt**: Secure the AI's intelligence with encryption
3. **Mint**: Create an INFT containing the encrypted AI
4. **Own**: Have complete ownership and control over the AI agent

## Technical Foundation

INFTs are built on **ERC-7857**, a new NFT standard that extends ERC-721 with:

- **Encrypted metadata storage** for protecting AI intelligence
- **Secure re-encryption** for safe ownership transfers  
- **Oracle verification** to ensure transfer integrity
- **Authorized usage** for AI-as-a-Service models

## Powered by 0G

INFTs leverage the complete 0G ecosystem:

| Component | Role | Benefit |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **0G Storage** | Encrypted AI storage | Permanent, decentralized availability |
| **0G Chain** | Smart contract execution | Fast, low-cost INFT operations |
| **0G Compute** | Secure AI inference | Private execution environment |
| **0G DA** | Transfer verification | Guaranteed data availability |
