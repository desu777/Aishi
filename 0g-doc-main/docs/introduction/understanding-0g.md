# Understanding 0G

import LottieAnimation from '@site/src/components/lottieAnimation';

## Why 0G Exists

AI (Artificial Intelligence) is rapidly advancing, but its powerful capabilities are largely confined to centralized systems & limited to a few large companies. Bringing AI onto the blockchain unlocks transformative potential: truly verifiable AI, user-owned data powering AI applications, and open, censorship-resistant AI development.

However, a fundamental challenge has held back this vision:
- **AI's Data Hunger:** AI models and datasets are massive. Existing blockchains make storing and accessing this data impossibly expensive and slow.
- **Intense Compute Demands:** AI requires significant processing power, far beyond what traditional blockchains can offer efficiently.
- **Need for Speed:** Real-time AI applications demand high throughput and low latency

Without overcoming these hurdles, the dream of decentralized AI remains out of reach.

**0G is built to break these barriers.** We provide the foundational infrastructure like high-performance storage, scalable compute, and a fast, modular blockchain—designed from the ground up to power the future of on-chain AI.

## What is 0G?

0G (Zero Gravity) is the first decentralized AI L1 chain that orchestrates hardware resources (storage, compute) and software assets (data, models) to handle AI workloads at scale. It bridges the gap between Web2 AI capabilities and Web3 decentralization.

:::info 0G is building the global foundation for a better, fairer, and more open AI ecosystem, where power is distributed and innovation thrives
:::

**How it works**: 0G provides four independent services that solve different pieces of the AI + blockchain puzzle:
- **Storage** → Where to keep massive AI datasets
- **Compute** → How to run AI models economically  
- **Chain** → Where to execute AI transactions quickly
- **Data Availability** → How to ensure data is always accessible

## Modular Architecture

:::tip Key Benefit of Modular Architecture: You DON'T need to use all of 0G!
**Pick only what you need:**
- **Already on Ethereum, Polygon, or any EVM chain?** Use 0G Storage and Compute directly from your existing smart contracts, no need to migrate.
- **Building on Solana or other non-EVM chains?** Our SDKs support cross-chain integration
- **Just need one service?** Use only 0G Storage or only 0G Compute

## The 4 Components of 0G

| Component             | Works Independently?                                   | Key Features & Use Cases                                                          | Cost Highlight                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **0G Chain**        | ✅ Yes (Optional for other services)             | Fastest modular EVM L1 for AI agents, DeFi with AI logic        | Low gas fees in 0G token              |
| **0G Storage**     | ✅ Yes (Any app/chain can access)                       | Store AI models (GBs-TBs), training datasets, user files, game assets            | 10-100x cheaper than alternatives     |
| **0G Compute**     | ✅ Yes (Any app/chain can access)                     | Run AI inference, model training, verifiable compute, ML pipelines               | Pay-only-for-what-you-use             |
| **0G DA**          | ✅ Yes (Works with any rollup/L1/L2)                  | Power gaming chains, AI rollups, high-frequency trading chains                   | Economical for high-volume DA         |

*\*0G Storage can be used completely standalone without any blockchain integration - perfect for traditional apps needing decentralized storage.*

## Key Concepts Explained Simply

<details>
<summary>**What is decentralized storage?**</summary>

Instead of storing your files on one company's computer (like Google Drive), they're split and stored across hundreds of computers worldwide.

**Why it matters**: If Google's servers crash, you lose access. With decentralized storage, even if 50 computers fail, your data is still safe and accessible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is data availability?**</summary>

It's a guarantee that your data can always be accessed when needed, like having multiple backup generators for your house.

**Why it matters**: In blockchain, if data isn't available, the whole system can freeze. 0G ensures this never happens.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is an AI compute network?**</summary>

It's like Uber for computing power - connect to available GPUs when you need to run AI models, pay only for what you use.

**Why it matters**: Instead of buying expensive GPUs or relying on big tech companies, access computing power on-demand from a global network.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**What is a modular blockchain?**</summary>

Like LEGO blocks, each part of the blockchain (storing data, processing transactions, reaching agreement) is separate and can be upgraded independently.

**Why it matters**: Traditional blockchains are like old phones where you can't upgrade just the camera. Modular blockchains let you improve each part without rebuilding everything.
</details>

## Why "Zero Gravity"?

"0G" represents "Zero Gravity" - the state where everything flows effortlessly. Just as astronauts move freely in zero gravity, data and AI computations flow seamlessly through our network without the heavy "gravity" of:
- High costs
- Slow speeds  
- Technical barriers
- Platform lock-in

## What Can You Build?

With 0G's technology, previously impossible use cases are now within reach:

- **On-chain AI agents** that learn and evolve
- **Decentralized ChatGPT** alternatives
- **AI-powered DeFi** trading systems
- **Medical AI** with patient-owned data
- **Large-scale ML training** without AWS bills

And this is just the beginning.
