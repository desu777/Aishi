### üöÄ The Problem We Solve
Your AI application needs:
- **Massive storage** for training data (TBs of datasets)
- **GPU compute** for model inference ($10K+/month on centralized providers)
- **Fast data availability** for real-time responses
- **Decentralization** without sacrificing performance

:::success Modular Infrastructure
0G provides all of this in one integrated ecosystem - or use just the parts you need.
