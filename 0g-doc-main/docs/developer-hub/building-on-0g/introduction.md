# Building on 0G

Build AI-powered applications using 0G's modular infrastructure - with or without migrating your existing code.

**Keep your current blockchain and add 0G services as needed.** Our infrastructure works with:
- âœ… Any EVM chain (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Arbitrum)
- âœ… Non-EVM chains (Solana, Near, Cosmos)
- âœ… Traditional Web2 applications

## Prerequisites

Before building:
1. **Get testnet tokens** from the [faucet](https://faucet.0g.ai)
2. **Install relevant SDK** for your language
3. **Review service documentation** for your chosen components

## What's Next?

Based on your needs, dive into:

- **Need Storage?** â†’ [Storage SDK Guide](/developer-hub/building-on-0g/storage/sdk)
- **Need Compute?** â†’ [Compute Integration](/developer-hub/building-on-0g/compute-network/sdk)
- **Building a Rollup?** â†’ [DA Integration](/developer-hub/building-on-0g/da-integration)
- **Creating INFTs?** â†’ [INFT Overview](/developer-hub/building-on-0g/inft/inft-overview)

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip**: Start with one service, prove the value, then expand. Most successful projects begin with 0G Storage or Compute before exploring other services.
