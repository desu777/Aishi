# Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
## Regulation S Compliance
The sale follows Regulation S guidelines, restricting U.S. persons from participating. The sale website, promotional content, and user interface clearly indicate these restrictions, and KYC verification is mandatory for claiming rewards to maintain regulatory adherence. Prospective participants are advised to review these conditions and understand that resale of node licenses is not permitted within the first 12 months.
## Information Disclosure
All communications related to the sale are made with transparency but exclude any directed selling to U.S. persons. Information shared in marketing materials, promotional activities, and social media avoids U.S.-targeted content, aligning with compliance requirements to mitigate any regulatory risks.
